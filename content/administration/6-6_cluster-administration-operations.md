The cluster operation control command interpreter (hereinafter referred to gs_sh) is a command line interface tool to manage GridDB cluster operations and data operations.

The following can be carried out by gs_sh.

*   Operation control of GridDB cluster
    *   Definition of GridDB cluster
    *   Starting and stopping a GridDB node and cluster
    *   Status, log display
*   GridDB cluster data operation
    *   Database and user management
    *   Collection, trigger display
    *   Index setting, deletion
    *   Search using a tql/sql

**\[Memo\]**

*   All functions provided in the GridDB operating commands are planned to be provided as gs\_sh subcommands. Where possible, use of gs\_sh is recommended as there is a possibility that the operating commands may be deleted in future releases. See the chapter on “Operating Commands” for details of the operating commands.

### Using gs_sh

### Preliminary Preparations

Carry out the following preparations before using gs_sh.

*   GridDB setup
    
    *   Installation of GridDB node, client library
    *   User creation
    *   Network setting (GridDB cluster definition file, node definition file)
    
    　See the chapter on “System Design & Construction” in the “GridDB Quick Start Guide” ([GridDB_QuickStartGuide.html](/en/docs/manuals/v3.1/GridDB_QuickStartGuide.html)) for details on the procedure.
    
*   Remote connection setting using SSH
    
    *   This setting is necessary in order to connect to each GridDB node execution environment from the gs_sh execution environment as an OS user “gsadm”.
    
    　*See the manual of each OS for details on the SSH connection procedure.
    

### gs_sh start-up

There are two types of start modes in gs_sh.

*   Startup in interactive mode
    
    *   The interactive mode is started when gs\_sh is executed without any arguments. The gs\_sh prompt will appear, allowing subcommands to be entered.
    *   Example:
    
    $ gs_sh
    // execution of subcommand “version”
    gs> version
    gs_sh version 2.0.0
    
    **\[Memo\]**
    
    *   When a subcommand is started in the interactive mode,
        *   a .gssh_history file is created in the home directory of the execution user and saved in the history.
        *   Click the arrow key to display/execute up to 20 subcommands started earlier.
        *   Enter some of the subcommands and click the Tab key to display a list of the subcommand input candidates.
*   Startup in batch mode
    
    *   When the script file for user creation is specified in gs\_sh, the system will be started in the batch mode. Batch processing of a series of subcommands described in the script file will be carried out. gs\_sh will terminate at the end of the batch processing.
    *   Example:
    
    // specify the script file (test.gsh) and execute
    $ gs_sh test.gsh
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Execute gs_sh commands as the OS user “gsadm”.
*   During gs_sh startup, .gsshrc script files under the gsadm user home directory are imported automatically. The .gsshrc contents will also be imported to the destination from other script files.
*   Extension of script file is gsh.
*   A script file is described using the character code UTF-8.

### Definition of a GridDB Cluster

### GridDB cluster operation controls

The following operations can be executed by the administrator user only as functions to manage GridDB cluster operations.

*   GridDB node start, stop, join cluster, leave cluster (startnode/stopnode/joincluster/leavecluster)
*   GridDB cluster operation start, operation stop (startcluster/stopcluster)
*   Increase the number of new nodes in a GridDB cluster (appendcluster)
*   Get various data

### Cluster status

This section explains the status of a GridDB node and GridDB cluster.

A cluster is composed of 1 or more nodes.  
The node status represents the status of the node itself e.g. start or stop etc.  
The cluster status represents the acceptance status of data operations from a client. Cluster statuses are determined according to the status of the node group constituting the cluster.

An example of the change in the node status and cluster status due to a gs_sh subcommand operation is shown below.  
A cluster is composed of 4 nodes.  
When the nodes constituting the cluster are started (startnode), the node status changes to “Start”. When the cluster is started after starting the nodes (startcluster), each node status changes to “Join”, and the cluster status also changes to “In Operation”.

![Status example](/images/statusSample.png)

Status example

  
A detailed explanation of the node status and cluster status is given below.  

*   Node status

Node status changes to “Stop”, “Start” or “Join” depending on whether a node is being started, stopped, joined or detached.  
If a node has joined a cluster, there are 2 types of node status depending on the status of the joined cluster.

![Node status](/images/nodeStatus.png)

Node status

  

Status

Status name

Description

Join

SERVICING

Node is joined to the cluster, and the status of the joined cluster is “In Operation”

WAIT

Node is joined to the cluster, and the status of the joined cluster is “Halted”

Start

STARTED

Node is started but has not joined a cluster

STARTING

Starting node

Stop

STOP

Stop node

STOPPING

Stopping node

　

*   Cluster status
    
    GridDB cluster status changes to “Stop”, “Halted” or “In Operation” depending on the operation start/stop status of the GridDB cluster or the join/leave operation of the GridDB node. Data operations from the client can be accepted only when the GridDB cluster status is “In Operation”.
    
    ![Cluster status](/images/clusterStatus.png)
    
    Cluster status
    
      
    
    Status
    
    Status name
    
    Description
    
    Operation
    
    SERVICE_STABLE
    
    All nodes defined in the cluster configuration have joined the cluster
    
    SERVICE_UNSTABLE
    
    More than half the nodes defined in the cluster configuration have joined the cluster
    
    Halted
    
    WAIT
    
    More than half the nodes defined in the cluster configuration have left the cluster
    
    INIT_WAIT
    
    1 or more of the nodes defined in the cluster configuration have left the cluster (when the cluster is operated for the first time, the status will not change to “In Operation” unless all nodes have joined the cluster)
    
    Stop
    
    STOP
    
    All nodes defined in the cluster configuration have left the cluster
    
    The GridDB cluster status will change from “Stop” to “In Operation” when all nodes constituting the GridDB cluster are allowed to join the cluster. In addition, the GridDB cluster status will change to “Halted” when more than half the nodes have left the cluster, and “Stop” when all the nodes have left the cluster.
    
    Join and leave operations (which affect the cluster status) can be applied in batch to all the nodes in the cluster, or to individual node.
    
      
    
    When all nodes are subject to the operation
    
    When the operating target is a single node
    
    Operation
    
    Join
    
    [startcluster](#*GridDBクラスタへノード一括参加) Batch entry of a group of nodes that are already operating but have not joined the cluster yet.
    
    [joincluster](#*GridDBクラスタへノード参加) Entry by a node that is in operation but has not joined the cluster yet.
    
    Left
    
    [stopcluster](#*GridDBクラスタからノード一括離脱) Batch detachment of a group of nodes attached to a cluster.
    
    [leavecluster](#*GridDBクラスタからノード離脱) Detachment of a node attached to a cluster.
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Join and leave cluster operations can be carried out on nodes that are in operation only.
*   A node which has failed will be detached automatically from the GridDB cluster.
*   The GridDB cluster status can be checked with the cluster status data display subcommand ([configcluster](#sec-4.4.9)).

Details of the various operating methods are explained below.

*   Append "$" in front of the variable name when using a variable.
*   In a stopnode sub-command, nodes which have joined the GridDB cluster cannot be stopped. In a stopnodeforce command, nodes which have joined the GridDB cluster can also be stopped but data may be lost.

### Batch entry of nodes in a cluster

Explanation on how to add batch nodes into a cluster is shown below. In this case when a group of unattached but operating nodes are added to the cluster, the cluster status will change to In Operation.

*   Sub-command
    
      
    
    startcluster
    
    Cluster variable \[Timeout time in sec.\]
    
*   Description of each argument
    
      
    
    Argument
    
    Description
    
    Cluster variable
    
    Specify a GridDB cluster by its cluster variable.
    
    Timeout time in sec.
    
    Specify the wait time after node start-up is completed.
    
    Immediate recovery if -1 is specified. Wait with no time limit if nothing is specified, or 0 is specified.
    
*   Example:
    
    // start GridDB cluster
    gs> startcluster $cluster1
    Waiting for cluster to start.
    Cluster has started.
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Command can be executed by an administrator user only.
*   Append "$" in front of the variable name when using a variable.
*   To change the status of a GridDB cluster from “Stop” to “In Operation”, all nodes must be allowed to join the cluster. Check beforehand that all nodes constituting the GridDB cluster are in operation.

### Batch detachment of nodes from a cluster

Explanation on how to perform batch detachment of nodes in the cluster is shown below. To stop a GridDB cluster, simply make the attached nodes leave the cluster using the stopluster command.

    Timeout time in sec.
    
    Specify the wait time after node start-up is completed.
    
    Immediate recovery if -1 is specified. Wait with no time limit if nothing is specified, or 0 is specified.
    
*   Example:
    
    // stop GridDB cluster
    gs> stopcluster $cluster1
    Waiting for a cluster to stop.
    Cluster has stopped.
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Command can be executed by an administrator user only.
*   Append "$" in front of the variable name when using a variable.

### Node entry in a cluster

Explanation on how to attach a node into a cluster is shown below. Use the joincluster command to attach the node.

*   Sub-command
    
      
    
    joincluster
    
    Cluster variable node variable \[Timeout time in sec.\]
    
*   Description of each argument
    
      
    
    Argument
    
    Description
    
    Cluster variable
    
    Specify a GridDB cluster by its cluster variable.
    
    Node variable
    
    Specify the node to join with the node variable.
    
    Timeout time in sec.
    
    Specify the wait time after node start-up is completed.
    
    Immediate recovery if -1 is specified. Wait with no time limit if nothing is specified, or 0 is specified.

    All nodes have been started.
    // join node
    joincluster $cluster1 $node2
    Waiting for a node to be joined to a cluster.
    Node has joined the cluster.
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Command can be executed by an administrator user only.
*   Append "$" in front of the variable name when using a variable.
*   Only nodes that are in operation can join a GridDB cluster. Check that the nodes joining a cluster are in operation.
*   Use the appendcluster sub-command when adding a node that is not yet defined in the cluster’s configuration to the cluster (the node is not part of the cluster).

### Detaching a node from a cluster

Explanation on how to remove a node from a cluster is shown below. Use the leavecluster or leavecluster force command to detach the node.

*   Sub-command
    
      
    
    leavecluster
    
    Node variable \[Timeout time in sec.\]
    
    leaveclusterforce
    
    Node variable \[Timeout time in sec.\]
    
*   Description of each argument
    
      
    
    Argument
    
    Description
    
    Node variable
    
    Specify the node to detach with the node variable.
    
    Timeout time in sec.
    
    Specify the wait time after node start-up is completed.
    
    Immediate recovery if -1 is specified. Wait with no time limit if nothing is specified, or 0 is specified.
    
*   Example:
    
    // leave node
    gs> leavecluster $node2
    Waiting for node to separate from cluster
    Node has separated from cluster.
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Command can be executed by an administrator user only.
*   Append "$" in front of the variable name when using a variable.
*   A node can safely leave a GridDB cluster only when the data has been duplicated in other nodes. However, a leavecluster subcommand forces a node to leave regardless of whether the data has been duplicated or not and so there is always a risk of data loss. Use the gs_leavecluster command to detach a node. See the section on “System Design & Construction - Designing Tuning Parameters” in the “GridDB Quick Start Guide” ([GridDB_QuickStartGuide.html](/en/docs/manuals/v3.1/GridDB_QuickStartGuide.html)) for details regarding data duplication.
*   A leaveclusterforce command forces a node to leave a cluster even if there is a risk that data may be lost due to the detachment.

### Adding a note to a cluster

Explanation on how to append a node to a pre-defined cluster is shown below. Use the appendcluster command to add the node.

*   Sub-command
    
      
    
    appendcluster
    
    Cluster variable node variable \[Timeout time in sec.\]
    
*   Description of each argument
    
      
    
    Argument
    
    Description
    
    Cluster variable
    
    Specify a GridDB cluster by its cluster variable.
    
    Node variable
    
    Specify the node to join with the node variable.
    
    Timeout time in sec.
    
    Specify the wait time after node start-up is completed.
    
    Immediate recovery if -1 is specified. Wait with no time limit if nothing is specified, or 0 is specified.
    
*   Example:
    
    // define node
    gs> setnode node5 192.168.0.5 10044
    // start node
    gs> startnode $node5
    // increase no. of nodes
    gs> appendcluster $cluster1 $node5
    Waiting for a node to be added to a cluster.
    A node has been added to the cluster.
    Add node variables$ node5 to cluster variable $cluster1. (Execute a save command when saving changes to a variable. )
    
    Cluster\[name=name1,239.0.5.111:33333,nodes=($node1,$node2,$node3,$node4,$node5)\]
    

**\[Memo\]**

*   Command can be executed by an administrator user only.
*   Append "$" in front of the variable name when using a variable.
*   To increase the number of new nodes, all nodes that constitute a GridDB cluster needs to join the cluster. If there is any node detached from the GridDB cluster, re-attach the nodes first. In addition, check that the new node to be added is in operation.
*   When executing an appendcluster subcommand, the node variable to be added is added to the cluster variable automatically. There is no need to manually change the cluster variable definition.
*   If a variable is changed, execute a save command to save the data. Unsaved contents will be discarded.
*   See the chapter on “System Design & Construction” in the “GridDB Quick Start Guide” ([GridDB_QuickStartGuide.html](/en/docs/manuals/v3.1/GridDB_QuickStartGuide.html)) for details on how to set up a new node.
